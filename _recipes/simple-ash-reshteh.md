image: simple-ash-reshteh.jpg
tags: soup, bon-appetit, work-in-progress

ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, finely grated
- ½ cup cranberry or navy beans, soaked overnight or boiled for 1 hour, drained
- ½ cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight or boiled for 1 hour, drained
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- ½ cup green lentils, rinsed
- 5 ounces baby spinach (about 7 cups), chopped
- 1 cup chopped cilantro leaves with tender stems
- 1 cup chopped parsley
- ½ cup chopped dill
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper to taste

components:
- Charred Onions
- Kahsk Substitute
- Mint Oil

equipment:
- Heavy 4-6 quart pot
- Medium skillet (anything but non-stick, you want to use some high heat)
- Spice grinder or mortar and pestle

directions:
- Heat oil in a large pot over medium. Add finely chopped onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and soft, 6–8 minutes.
- Add garlic, cranberry beans, chickpeas, and turmeric and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
- Add 8 cups cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are halfway cooked (they should still be very al dente), 25–35 minutes.
- Add lentils and cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are creamy but still hold their shape, and lentils are tender, 25–35 minutes (the soup may look a bit thick, but don’t fret; the greens will release liquid when they’re added, thinning the soup out a bit).
- Add spinach, cilantro, parsley, and dill and cook until greens are just wilted and have slightly darkened, 4–6 minutes.
- Stir in lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.
- Divide soup among bowls and pour a tablespoon or two of Kahsk Substitute over soup. Drizzle mint oil over soup, then top with charred onions.

I first fell in love with ash reshteh at a Persian culture festival in Irvine that my Iranian neighbors brought me to.
It took me over a decade to find it again, and I was happy to find the soup is easy to make, healthy, and just as delicious as I remembered it.

I pulled this recipe from [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/beans-green-soup-with-yogurt-mint). While not completely authentic, it's close enough to satisfy my nostalgia on a weeknight.
It's missing the liguini-like reshteh noodles and substitutes kahsk (a sun-dried fermented yogurt/whey) for more easily accessible greek yogurt and buttermilk.

If you don't have time to soak the beans and chickpeas the night before, pre-boil them separately for one hour. And don't skimp on the charred onions at the end, they really make the dish!
