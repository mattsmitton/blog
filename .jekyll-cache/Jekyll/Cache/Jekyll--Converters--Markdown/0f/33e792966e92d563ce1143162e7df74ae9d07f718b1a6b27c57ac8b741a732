I"ï<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Matt. Iâ€™m an operations engineer by day, and I like to make food while my infrastructure code converges.
Instead of texting family members and posting food pics to Instagram, Iâ€™ve decided to start a recipe blog!</p>

<p>This blog was created using a neat markdown-based recipe database called <a href="https://github.com/clarklab/chowdown">chowdown</a>.
Hope you like it.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Matt Smitton</p>

<p>PS. Send me your thoughts/suggestions/recipes here: m@smitton.io</p>
