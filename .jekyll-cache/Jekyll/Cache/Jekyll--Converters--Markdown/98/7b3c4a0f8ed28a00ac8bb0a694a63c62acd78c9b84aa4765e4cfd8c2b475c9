<p>A cornbread recipe I’ve cobbled together over the years from a few different sources (Anson Mills, SeriousEats, etc…). The sour cream should keep things moist, and the brown butter adds a nice nutty richness without adding any effort – just put the butter in the skillet while it heats up!</p>

<p>Fold a few roasted and diced green hatch chile peppers into the batter if you want to kick it up another notch.</p>

<p>Scale up by 1.5x if using a 12-inch skillet.</p>
