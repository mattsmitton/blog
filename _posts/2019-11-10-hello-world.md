Hi, I'm Matt. I'm an operations engineer by day, and I like to make food while my infrastructure code converges.
Instead of texting family members and posting food pics to Instagram, I've decided to start a recipe blog!

This blog was created using a neat markdown-based recipe database called [chowdown](https://github.com/clarklab/chowdown).
Hope you like it.

Cheers,
Matt Smitton
